          After much inner turmoil I am reluctantly relegating Cutthroat Tenkara to the back burner. 
          It was a grand idea that never really took off...
          The cost in both time and money to run this small site was also too great to justify.
          <br />
          I have a lot of projects on my plate. Perhaps maybe I will eventually resurrect Cutthroat Tenkara.  
          That eventuality will be contingent on me being able to go tenkara fly fishing more than a few times a year...
