          After much inner turmoil I am reluctantly stepping away from running Cutthroat Tenkara. The cost in both time and money to run this small site was too great to justify.
          I have a lot of projects on my plate. Maybe eventually though I will resurrect Cutthroat Tenkara. Perhaps one day when I am able to go tenkara fly fishing more than a few times a year...
